# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis

The purpose of this project is to analyze Amazon reviews that were written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. The Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and pulishers to get reviews for their products. Companies pay Amazon to provide their products to Amazon Vine Members so they can publish reviews. We need to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members. 

## Results

There were 136 Vine reviews and 18,019 non-Vine reviews.

There were 74 Vine reviews with 5 stars. There were 8,482 non-Vine reviews with 5 stars.

54.41% of Vine reviews were 5 stars. 47.07% of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars.

## Summary

There is a small bias between 5 star reviews from Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews. Paid Vine reviews accounted for 7% more 5 star reviews than unpaid reviews.
